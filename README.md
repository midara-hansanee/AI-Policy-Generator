# AI-Policy-Generator
This project aimed to address the challenge of managing and interpreting large, complex policy documents efficiently, while also enabling the generation of new, scenario-based policy drafts. Here's a breakdown of what we accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ Summary Generator:
Designed to automatically condense lengthy policy documents into clear, concise summaries without losing critical information. We implemented advanced text preprocessing techniques, fine-tuned summarization models, and optimized the output for clarity and relevance.

ðŸ”¹ Policy Generator:
Built an AI-driven tool capable of generating policy drafts based on different user-defined scenarios. We fine-tuned a generative model, engineered effective prompts, and ensured that the outputs aligned with realistic policy structures and language.

ðŸ”¹ Key Processes Involved:

Document preprocessing and cleaning

Designing and testing prompt templates

Fine-tuning large language models

Implementing summarization and text generation pipelines

Developing a user-friendly web application to integrate the tools

This project gave me hands-on experience with natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, model evaluation, and web development. It was an exciting opportunity to combine technical skills with real-world policy applications and see firsthand how AI can support decision-making processes.
